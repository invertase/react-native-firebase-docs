# Authentication

```
firebase.auth
```

## Methods 

The following methods are accessed via the Auth instance `firebase.auth()`.

### onAuthStateChanged
[method]onAuthStateChanged(listener) returns function;[/method]

Adds an observer for changes to the user's sign-in state.

Returns an unsubscriber function.

| Parameter |         |
| --------- | ------- |
| listener  | **function([ref auth.User] or null)** |

### onUserChanged
[method]onUserChanged(listener) returns function;[/method]

> This is an experimental feature and is only part of React Native Firebase.

Adds a listener to observe changes to the [ref auth.User] object. This is a superset of everything from [ref auth.auth#onAuthStateChanged], [ref auth.auth#onIdTokenChanged] and user changes. The goal of this method is to provide easier listening to **all** user changes, such as when credentials are linked and unlinked, without manually having to call `.reload()`.

Returns an unsubscriber function.

| Parameter |         |
| --------- | ------- |
| listener  | **function([ref auth.User] or null)** |

[collapse Example]
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import firebase from 'react-native-firebase';

export default class MyComponent extends Component {

  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = firebase.auth().onUserChanged(this.onUserChanged);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) this.unsubscribe();
  }

  onUserChanged = (currentUser) => {
    if (currentUser) {
      console.log(currentUser.toJSON())
    }
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Hello World</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
[/collapse]


### onIdTokenChanged
[method]onIdTokenChanged(listener) returns function;[/method]

Adds an observer for changes to the signed-in user's ID token, which includes sign-in, sign-out, and token refresh events.

Returns an unsubscriber function.

| Parameter |         |
| --------- | ------- |
| listener  | **function** |

### signOut
[method]signOut() returns Promise containing void;[/method]

Signs out the current user.

### signInAnonymously
[method]signInAnonymously() returns Promise containing [ref auth.User];[/method]

Asynchronously signs in as an anonymous user.

This method will be deprecated and will be updated to resolve with a `firebase.auth.UserCredential` as is returned in [ref auth.Auth#signInAnonymouslyAndRetrieveData].

If there is already an anonymous user signed in, that user will be returned; otherwise, a new anonymous user identity will be created and returned.

#### Error Codes

| Code | Message |
| --------- | ------- |
| auth/operation-not-allowed   | Thrown if anonymous accounts are not enabled. Enable anonymous accounts in the Firebase Console, under the Auth tab.  |

### signInAnonymouslyAndRetrieveData
[method]signInAnonymously() returns Promise containing [ref auth.UserCredential];[/method]

Signs in a user anonymously and returns any additional user info data or credentials.

This method will be renamed to `signInAnonymously` replacing the existing method with the same name in the next major version change.

If there is already an anonymous user signed in, that user with additional date will be returned; otherwise, a new anonymous user identity will be created and returned.

#### Error Codes

| Code | Message |
| --------- | ------- |
| auth/operation-not-allowed   | Thrown if anonymous accounts are not enabled. Enable anonymous accounts in the Firebase Console, under the Auth tab.  |

### createUserAndRetrieveDataWithEmailAndPassword
[method]createUserAndRetrieveDataWithEmailAndPassword(email, password) returns Promise containing [ref auth.UserCredential];[/method]

Creates a new user account associated with the specified email address and password and returns any additional user info data or credentials.

This method will be renamed to `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` replacing the existing method with the same name in the next major version change.

On successful creation of the user account, this user will also be signed in to your application.

User account creation can fail if the account already exists or the password is invalid.

Note: The email address acts as a unique identifier for the user and enables an email-based password reset. This function will create a new user account and set the initial user password.

Parameter |         |
| --------- | ------- |
| email     | **string**  |
| password     | **string** |

#### Error Codes

| Code | Message |

### createUserWithEmailAndPassword
[method]createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password) returns Promise containing [ref auth.User];[/method]

Creates a new user account associated with the specified email address and password.

This method will be deprecated and will be updated to resolve with a `firebase.auth.UserCredential` as is returned in [ref auth.Auth#createUserAndRetrieveDataWithEmailAndPassword].

On successful creation of the user account, this user will also be signed in to your application.

### signInAndRetrieveDataWithCredential
[method]signInAndRetrieveDataWithCredential(credential) returns Promise containing [ref auth.UserCredential];[/method]

Asynchronously signs in with the given credentials, and returns any available additional user information, such as user name.

## Properties

The following properties are accessed via the Auth instance `firebase.auth()`.

### app
[method]app return [ref core.App];[/method]

The app associated with this Auth service instance.

### currentUser
[method]currentUser returns [ref auth.User] or null;[/method]

The currently signed-in user (or null if no user signed in).

### languageCode
[method]languageCode returns String or null;[/method]

The current Auth instance's language code. This is a readable/writable property. When set to null, the default Firebase Console language setting is applied. The language code will propagate to email action templates (password reset, email verification and email change revocation) and SMS templates for phone authentication operations provided the specified providers support localization with the language code specified.

[collapse Example]
```js
console.log(firebase.auth().languageCode); // null
firebase.auth().languageCode = 'fr';
console.log(firebase.auth().languageCode); // 'fr'
```
[/collapse]

## Unsupported Methods

The following methods are not supported in RNFirebase as they cannot work in the React Native environment or have a different implementation.

### getRedirectResult

### setPersistence

### signInWithPopup

### signInWithRedirect

### useDeviceLanguage

An outstanding iOS SDK bug is preventing `useDeviceLanguage` from being supported. Until this is fix, we recommend using `languageCode` to set the language by using an external [library](https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info) to get the device locale.
