# Authentication

```
firebase.auth
```

## Methods 

The following methods are accessed via the Auth instance `firebase.auth()`.

### onAuthStateChanged
[method]onAuthStateChanged(listener) returns function;[/method]

Adds an observer for changes to the user's sign-in state.

Returns an unsubscriber function.

| Parameter |         |
| --------- | ------- |
| listener  | **function([ref auth.User] or null)** |

### onUserChanged
[method]onUserChanged(listener) returns function;[/method]

> This is an experimental feature and is only part of React Native Firebase.

Adds a listener to observe changes to the [ref auth.User] object. This is a superset of everything from [ref auth.auth#onAuthStateChanged], [ref auth.auth#onIdTokenChanged] and user changes. The goal of this method is to provide easier listening to **all** user changes, such as when credentials are linked and unlinked, without manually having to call `.reload()`.

Returns an unsubscriber function.

| Parameter |         |
| --------- | ------- |
| listener  | **function([ref auth.User] or null)** |

[collapse Example]
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import firebase from 'react-native-firebase';

export default class MyComponent extends Component {

  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = firebase.auth().onUserChanged(this.onUserChanged);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) this.unsubscribe();
  }

  onUserChanged = (currentUser) => {
    if (currentUser) {
      console.log(currentUser.toJSON())
    }
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Hello World</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
[/collapse]


### onIdTokenChanged
[method]onIdTokenChanged(listener) returns function;[/method]

Adds an observer for changes to the signed-in user's ID token, which includes sign-in, sign-out, and token refresh events.

Returns an unsubscriber function.

| Parameter |         |
| --------- | ------- |
| listener  | **function** |

### signOut
[method]signOut() returns Promise containing void;[/method]

Signs out the current user.

### signInAnonymously
[method]signInAnonymously() returns Promise containing [ref auth.User];[/method]

Asynchronously signs in as an anonymous user.

This method will be deprecated and will be updated to resolve with a `firebase.auth.UserCredential` as is returned in [ref auth.auth#signInAnonymouslyAndRetrieveData].

If there is already an anonymous user signed in, that user will be returned; otherwise, a new anonymous user identity will be created and returned.

#### Error Codes

| Code | Message |
| --------- | ------- |
| auth/operation-not-allowed   | Thrown if anonymous accounts are not enabled. Enable anonymous accounts in the Firebase Console, under the Auth tab.  |

### signInAnonymouslyAndRetrieveData
[method]signInAnonymously() returns Promise containing [ref auth.UserCredential];[/method]

Signs in a user anonymously and returns any additional user info data or credentials.

This method will be renamed to `signInAnonymously` replacing the existing method with the same name in the next major version change.

If there is already an anonymous user signed in, that user with additional date will be returned; otherwise, a new anonymous user identity will be created and returned.

#### Error Codes

| Code | Message |
| --------- | ------- |
| auth/operation-not-allowed   | Thrown if anonymous accounts are not enabled. Enable anonymous accounts in the Firebase Console, under the Auth tab.  |

### createUserAndRetrieveDataWithEmailAndPassword
[method]createUserAndRetrieveDataWithEmailAndPassword(email, password) returns Promise containing [ref auth.UserCredential];[/method]

Creates a new user account associated with the specified email address and password and returns any additional user info data or credentials.

This method will be renamed to `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` replacing the existing method with the same name in the next major version change.

On successful creation of the user account, this user will also be signed in to your application.

User account creation can fail if the account already exists or the password is invalid.

Note: The email address acts as a unique identifier for the user and enables an email-based password reset. This function will create a new user account and set the initial user password.

Parameter |         |
| --------- | ------- |
| email     | **string**  |
| password     | **string** |

#### Error Codes

| Code | Message |

| auth/invalid-email  | Thrown if the email address is not valid. |
| auth/operation-not-allowed | Thrown if email/password accounts are not enabled. Enable email/password accounts in the Firebase Console, under the Auth tab. |
| auth/weak-password | Thrown if the password is not strong enough. |

### createUserWithEmailAndPassword
[method]createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password) returns Promise containing [ref auth.User];[/method]

Creates a new user account associated with the specified email address and password.

This method will be deprecated and will be updated to resolve with a `firebase.auth.UserCredential` as is returned in [ref auth.auth#createUserAndRetrieveDataWithEmailAndPassword].

On successful creation of the user account, this user will also be signed in to your application.

User account creation can fail if the account already exists or the password is invalid.

Note: The email address acts as a unique identifier for the user and enables an email-based password reset. This function will create a new user account and set the initial user password.

| auth/invalid-email  | Thrown if the email address is not valid. |
| auth/operation-not-allowed | Thrown if email/password accounts are not enabled. Enable email/password accounts in the Firebase Console, under the Auth tab. |
| auth/weak-password | Thrown if the password is not strong enough. |

### signInAndRetrieveDataWithCredential
[method]signInAndRetrieveDataWithCredential(credential) returns Promise containing [ref auth.UserCredential];[/method]

Asynchronously signs in with the given credentials, and returns any available additional user information, such as user name.

### verifyPhoneNumber
[method]verifyPhoneNumber(phoneNumber, autoVerifyTimeoutOrForceResend?: number | boolean, forceResend?: boolean) returns TODO;[/method]

This implementation gives you full control of the phone number verification flow on either platform as well as a flexible api to suit any UI flow and should be familiar to use if you've used things like storage, upload tasks / database on listeners. It is of particular use if you want to link a phone credential with an existing account rather than just sign the user in.

[collapse Example]

```js
firebase.auth()
  .verifyPhoneNumber(phoneNumber)
  .on('state_changed', (phoneAuthSnapshot) => {
    // How you handle these state events is entirely up to your ui flow and whether
    // you need to support both ios and android. In short: not all of them need to
    // be handled - it's entirely up to you, your ui and supported platforms.

    // E.g you could handle android specific events only here, and let the rest fall back
    // to the optionalErrorCb or optionalCompleteCb functions
    switch (phoneAuthSnapshot.state) {
      // ------------------------
      //  IOS AND ANDROID EVENTS
      // ------------------------
      case firebase.auth.PhoneAuthState.CODE_SENT: // or 'sent'
        console.log('code sent');
        // on ios this is the final phone auth state event you'd receive
        // so you'd then ask for user input of the code and build a credential from it
        // as demonstrated in the `signInWithPhoneNumber` example above
        break;
      case firebase.auth.PhoneAuthState.ERROR: // or 'error'
        console.log('verification error');
        console.log(phoneAuthSnapshot.error);
        break;

      // ---------------------
      // ANDROID ONLY EVENTS
      // ---------------------
      case firebase.auth.PhoneAuthState.AUTO_VERIFY_TIMEOUT: // or 'timeout'
        console.log('auto verify on android timed out');
        // proceed with your manual code input flow, same as you would do in
        // CODE_SENT if you were on IOS
        break;
      case firebase.auth.PhoneAuthState.AUTO_VERIFIED: // or 'verified'
        // auto verified means the code has also been automatically confirmed as correct/received
        // phoneAuthSnapshot.code will contain the auto verified sms code - no need to ask the user for input.
        console.log('auto verified on android');
        console.log(phoneAuthSnapshot);
        // Example usage if handling here and not in optionalCompleteCb:
        // const { verificationId, code } = phoneAuthSnapshot;
        // const credential = firebase.auth.PhoneAuthProvider.credential(verificationId, code);

        // Do something with your new credential, e.g.:
        // firebase.auth().signInWithCredential(credential);
        // firebase.auth().currentUser.linkWithCredential(credential);
        // etc ...
        break;
    }
  }, (error) => {
    // optionalErrorCb would be same logic as the ERROR case above,  if you've already handed
    // the ERROR case in the above observer then there's no need to handle it here
    console.log(error);
    // verificationId is attached to error if required
    console.log(error.verificationId);
  }, (phoneAuthSnapshot) => {
    // optionalCompleteCb would be same logic as the AUTO_VERIFIED/CODE_SENT switch cases above
    // depending on the platform. If you've already handled those cases in the observer then
    // there's absolutely no need to handle it here.

    // Platform specific logic:
    // - if this is on IOS then phoneAuthSnapshot.code will always be null
    // - if ANDROID auto verified the sms code then phoneAuthSnapshot.code will contain the verified sms code
    //   and there'd be no need to ask for user input of the code - proceed to credential creating logic
    // - if ANDROID auto verify timed out then phoneAuthSnapshot.code would be null, just like ios, you'd
    //   continue with user input logic.
    console.log(phoneAuthSnapshot);
  });
// optionally also supports .then & .catch instead of optionalErrorCb &
// optionalCompleteCb (with the same resulting args)
```

## Properties

The following properties are accessed via the Auth instance `firebase.auth()`.

### app
[method]app return [ref core.App];[/method]

The app associated with this Auth service instance.

### currentUser
[method]currentUser returns [ref auth.User] or null;[/method]

The currently signed-in user (or null if no user signed in).

### languageCode
[method]languageCode returns String or null;[/method]

The current Auth instance's language code. This is a readable/writable property. When set to null, the default Firebase Console language setting is applied. The language code will propagate to email action templates (password reset, email verification and email change revocation) and SMS templates for phone authentication operations provided the specified providers support localization with the language code specified.

[collapse Example]
```js
console.log(firebase.auth().languageCode); // null
firebase.auth().languageCode = 'fr';
console.log(firebase.auth().languageCode); // 'fr'
```

## Unsupported Methods

The following methods are not supported in RNFirebase as they cannot work in the React Native environment or have a different implementation.

### getRedirectResult

### setPersistence

### signInWithPopup

### signInWithRedirect

### useDeviceLanguage

An outstanding iOS SDK bug is preventing `useDeviceLanguage` from being supported. Until this is fix, we recommend using `languageCode` to set the language by using an external [library](https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info) to get the device locale.
